# The Odin Project: Tic Tac Toe

A tic tac toe game that can be played on the browser. This game has 2 modes, player x player or player x computer.
All the game manipulations are done using JavaScript, the goal on this project was to use as little global code as possible
trying to put everything inside functions, factory or modules. 

The computer plays random valid moves, further implementations are needed to add game difficulties selection
